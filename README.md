- 👋 Hi, I’m Luca Predieri!
- 👀 I’m interested in software, robotics and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to get my master degree in robotics engineering at Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. I graduated at Genoa in biomedical engineering with a thesis regarding the development of a videogame which aims to discover cognitive problems in old patients.
