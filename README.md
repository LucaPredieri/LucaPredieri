- :milky_way:  Hello, I’m Luca Predieri!
- :blue_heart:  I’m interested in software, robotics, music and philosophy. The goal for me is not having only one passion, I want to find the connection between them, the thread linking the brain to my heart.
- :earth_americas:  I’m currently studying to get my master degree in robotics engineering at Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. I graduated at Genoa in biomedical engineering with a thesis regarding the development of a videogame in Virtual Reality (using Unity 3D) which aims to discover cognitive problems in old patients.
